An object is hashable if it has a hash code which never changes during its lifetime (it
needs a __hash__() method), and can be compared to other objects (it needs an
__eq__() method). Hashable objects which compare equal must have the same hash
code.

Numeric types and flat immutable types str and bytes are all hashable. Container
types are hashable if they are immutable and all contained objects are also hashable.

The hash code of an object may be different depending on the version of Python, the
machine architecture, and because of a salt added to the hash computation for secu‐
rity reasons.3 The hash code of a correctly implemented object is guaranteed to be
constant only within one Python process.

User-defined types are hashable by default because their hash code is their id(), and
the __eq__() method inherited from the object class simply compares the object
IDs. If an object implements a custom __eq__() that takes into account its internal
state, it will be hashable only if its __hash__() always returns the same hash code. In
practice, this requires that __eq__() and __hash__() only take into account instance
attributes that never change during the life of the object.
